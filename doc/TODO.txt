FIX
===
* Make eZIEezcImageConverter use the eZ Publish image advanced settings (path to image magick, etc)
* The brightness filter doesn't respect the selected region
  * Fixed with imagemagick, not on GD
* The contrast filter doesn't respect the selected region
  * Fixed with imagemagick, not on GD
* Commit the cluster index changes to ezp svn so that the editor works with clustering

VERIFY
======
* Check how watermark files can be added
* Check what exact ezp version ezie requires
* Check if the following actions do support a region:
  * contrast:   OK on ImageMagick, still broken on GD
  * brightness  OK on ImageMagick, still broken on GD
  * pixelate:   OK
  * sepia:      OK
